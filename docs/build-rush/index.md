Build Rush is a build memorizing minigame for Minecraft!  
The goal is to memorize a structure and then rebuild it as fast and as correct as possible.

!!! note
    Current Build Rush documentation is made for the version v3.x.x.
    This means everything that is documented here is guaranteed to work on v3.x.x, but may not work on other versions.
